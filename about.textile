h2. My name is

Indraneel Purohit. I am currently a student at "Rutgers University":http://www.rutgers.edu, majoring in Computer Science, but studying many things.  I am an aspiring entrepreneur, and I intend on programming, thinking, hustling, speaking, listening and learning my way down such a path.  In my spare time, I enjoy making hip-hop music ("Listen!":http://www.soundcloud.com/indraneel), taking pictures ("Look!":http://www.flickr.com/indraneel24), in addition to more passive pursuits, like "listening to music":http://www.last.fm/user/indraneel24, reading books and watching television and films.

h2. This Site

After years of training myself in the art of the internet, I created this site to share (what I believe to be) the highest quality writing I have ever been capable of producing.  I will write about technology, music, world events, photography, and much more.
