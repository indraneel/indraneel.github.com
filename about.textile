h2. Indraneel Purohit

I am currently a student at "Rutgers University":http://www.rutgers.edu, majoring in Computer Science.  But I enjoy studying many other things, doing even more things, and reading about many more things.  I am an aspiring entrepreneur and leader, and I want to use my ever-growing skills in software development, public speaking and listening to fulfill my goals.  In my spare time, I enjoy "making hip-hop music":http://www.soundcloud.com/indraneel, "taking pictures":http://www.flickr.com/indraneel24, in addition to more passive pursuits, like "listening to music":http://www.last.fm/user/indraneel24, reading books and watching television and films.

I'm probably going to write about technology, music, world events, photography, mainly, but I don't plan on limiting myself to any of those.
