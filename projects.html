        <h2><SIRS Analysis</h2>
    <div class="post">
	This is a data analysis project of Rutgers professor review data.
	I scraped the data from <a href="http://sirs.ctaar.rutgers.edu">SIRS</a> and did linear regression on it to start.
	I have begun work on a web interface to accessing this data.
	
	<a href="http://github.com/indraneel/SIRS">Check out the code</a>.

	Python (Beautiful Soup, numpy, Flask)

	Vine is missing playlists.  I built it for them.

	JavaScript (Node.js, Angular, jQuery).
	<!--I used Python, Flask, JavaScript, the Rutgers API and Google Maps API to create a more human-readable interface for Rutgers' online busing system, NextBus.  Students and faculty simply input their desired bus stop and they are given the quickest bus route, the time their bus will take to get to the stop, how long it will take them to walk to the bus stop from where they are (accessed through HTML5's geolocation) and when they should leave to catch their bus.  All in all, an awesome web/mobile app that is super useful.  More features (search autocomplete for any building on the Rutgers New Brunswick campus and SMS reminders for when users need to leave) coming soon!-->

        I use Logic Pro, my pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50s and my Yamaha MIDI Baby Grand Electric Piano to produce hip hop tracks.
        <br />
        My production has even received praise from Himanshu Suri (formerly of Das Racist):
